Each HTML file has the earthquake data in reverse chronological order.
(However, for the purpose of this exercise, the ordering of data in the file
doesn't matter.)

Read the three HTML files, and capture the Magnitude value, Month and Year.

Then for each year and month, we'll print out how many earthquakes of
magnitude 6.0 and above happened. Print the value as a bar graph, where each
'*' represents one instance.

Write a function, 'caption_graph(caption, number)'. For this exercise,
assume that caption will never be more than 12 characters long (since it
will be month names). Ideally, the caption_graph() function should be in
separate module in a 'lib' sub-directory. which is in the same directory as
the main program.

Submit a zip-file which contain the contents of the directory.

The output should look something like:

               Recorded earthquakes of Magnitude 6.0 and above
2008
January:   *
February:  *********
...
December:  **

2009
January:   *******
... 



I got a note from one student who mentioned that the non-html files were not
created from the html files. He is correct about that.

For example, for the 2010 data, the .html file was obtained by going to this
link: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2010/ and doing a
'Save Page As...' and saving the html source. However, the corresponding
.txt file was obtained by just selecting the earthquake data on that page,
and doing a copy/paste of the text.

The plain text files were there just for the class exercise.  Sorry, about
not clarifying that. I hope you didn't waste too much time trying to debug
something that was a non-issue! (You may also notice that my .txt files are
sorted by magnitude, where as the data on the page is sorted
chronologically.)
