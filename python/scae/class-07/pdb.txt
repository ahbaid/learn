PDB Debugger:
=============

   From the interpreter:
   
   - import the pdb module
   - import <your module to debug>
   - pdb.run('<statement as string>')
   
   - in the debugger:
     - b func2 (stop at beginning of function)
     - c (continue)
     - b (to list all breakpoints)
     - p <var> (print variable)
     - ignore <breapoint> (ignore breakpoint n)
     - q (quit)
   
   From your code:
   
      import pdb
      pdb.set_trace() # drop into the debugger


Data Persistence & Db Programming:
==================================
Pickle module:
- save a data struct to a file
- read a data struct from a file
- no introspection of saved file, you need to know what's saved
