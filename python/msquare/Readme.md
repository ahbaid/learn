#Magic Squares

## The problem:
Given 16 numbers 1 through 16 and a 4 x 4 grid of squares:
* Enter each number once into a square
* Each row sums to 34
* Each column sums to 34
* Each diagonal sums to 34

## Hints:
* Find combinations of 4 numbers that sum to 34
* How many combinations are needed? There are 4 rows, 4 columns and 2 diagonals.

## Bonus:
* Solve so the sum of the 4 corners is 34.
* Solve so the sum of the 4 center squares is 34.
* Write a python program that solves this.
