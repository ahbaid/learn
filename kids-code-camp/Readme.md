# Kids Code Camp

## Welcome!
Humans understand recipes. We read a recipe, we interpret it, then we execute it 
to producce a meal. If a recipe is written in english, we need a human that understands
english.

Computers also understand recipes, we write these recipes in specific languages that
computers understand. These recipes are called programs. For a computer to interpret a 
program we need to run that program with an interpreter that understands the programs
language. 

Programs written in Python are run using the Pythomn interpreter. We will be coding
Python. What is coding? That's what we are here to learn!

Take a look at the sample starter program "hello.py" , run it using Python (version 3).
See if you can understand what it does!

Let's go code!
